"""Source repository: ../sanad (frozen Google Sanad).
Source commit: b65f569.
Source path: app/core/vitals.py.
Copy date: 2026-09-06.
Slice 04 modifications:
- Add provenance and boundary documentation.

Unknown is never normal; a missing protocol is not a safe result.
Screening covers readable text and captions only, never hidden content of
unprocessed media; callers own the media_failure route. A verdict is not a
diagnosis. Original adult cardiology cohort; Sanad v2 re-approval pending.

Owns the blood-pressure table, the way core/labs.py owns the lab table.

Until S5 a blood pressure was filed and shown and nothing in the build ever
called one dangerous. That was a deliberate gap and it is now closed with the
same mechanism the lab values use: a fixed table, in code, applied to the number
whether the patient typed it or photographed the machine.

The cutoffs used by this build:

    systolic  >= 180    hypertensive crisis   red card AND the emergency line
    diastolic >= 120    hypertensive crisis   red card AND the emergency line
    systolic  <   90    low blood pressure    red card AND the emergency line
    anything else       filed to the chart, no card of its own

Every red row reaches the patient as well as the doctor. S5 pass 1 shipped the
low row as a card to the doctor only, reading the spec sentence literally, and
asked whether that was the intent. It was not: a systolic under 90 at home is a
reading somebody should be seen for, so both red rows send the same emergency
block the Sentinel sends and the difference between them is only the wording on
the doctor's card.

Two numbers or nothing: half a blood pressure is not a blood pressure, and a
message that is not a reading at all is not this module's business. `parse()`
matches the whole message and nothing less, which is why "my pressure was 190"
is a sentence for the Concierge and "190/125" is a measurement for this table.

Pure functions, no I/O, no cloud SDK: this module and its tests run anywhere.
