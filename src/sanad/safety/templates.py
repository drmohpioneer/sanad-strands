"""Source repository: ../sanad (frozen Google Sanad).
Source commit: b65f569.
Source path: app/core/templates.py.
Copy date: 2026-09-06.
Slice 04 modifications:
- Add provenance and boundary documentation.
- Add deterministic urgent templates and import-time field checks.

Unknown is never normal; a missing protocol is not a safe result.
Screening covers readable text and captions only, never hidden content of
unprocessed media; callers own the media_failure route. A verdict is not a
diagnosis. Original adult cardiology cohort; Sanad v2 re-approval pending.

Owns the words the Care Coordinator and the Resolver may send a patient.

Sixteen sentences, that is the whole vocabulary: the five the Coordinator's
tools needed at S6, three more the administrative tier needed at S6++ item G,
four added at rev 17, and four added at S19 for the Resolver. The last two
groups sit together at the bottom of this file under marked blocks so a
reviewer reading the Arabic has one place to read. The Coordinator is an agent
with tools and it never writes a line: it picks a tool, and the tool sends one
of these, gendered by core/gender.py and in the patient's own language. The
only variable parts are a date, the doctor's name, the patient's first name and
the name of a missing analyte, and `render` refuses anything else, so a template
can never grow a number or a dose the doctor did not write.

The Resolver has one thing to say that no fixed sentence can carry: three real
laboratories with their addresses and opening hours. That block is not a
template and it is not generated either. It is assembled in code out of the
fields the Places API returned (core/places.Search.block) and sent underneath
one of the S19 sentences below, exactly as the doctor's own plan text is sent
underneath `plan_again`. No field of any template below carries an address, an
area or a count, so nothing a patient or a listing wrote can reach the inside
of a Sanad sentence.

The Chaser's ladder templates stay where they are (core/chaser.py): those are
the reminders S3 owns. These are the sentences the Coordinator needs and S3 had
no reason to have.

Arabic conjugates the second person, so each line exists in three forms: to a
man, to a woman, and, when the record does not say, in wording that commits to
neither. That is the same rule and the same three keys the Chaser uses.

Pure functions, no I/O, no cloud SDK: this module and its tests run anywhere.
