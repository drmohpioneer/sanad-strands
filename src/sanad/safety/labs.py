"""Source repository: ../sanad (frozen Google Sanad).
Source commit: b65f569.
Source path: app/core/labs.py.
Copy date: 2026-09-06.
Slice 04 modifications:
- Use sanad.safety imports.
- Add provenance and boundary documentation; no timing helper exists in this source.

Unknown is never normal; a missing protocol is not a safe result.
Screening covers readable text and captions only, never hidden content of
unprocessed media; callers own the media_failure route. A verdict is not a
diagnosis. Original adult cardiology cohort; Sanad v2 re-approval pending.

Owns the critical-lab table documented in docs/SAFETY.md and every comparison.

This is the determinism rule of S3 in one file. The model reads a slip into a
schema - analyte, value, unit, the slip's own printed reference range, the
slip's own printed flag - and stops there. Every judgement after that happens
here, in code, against three sources in this order:

  1. the critical-value table below, which never moves;
  2. the doctor's target for this patient, if he set one;
  3. the doctor's recorded baseline for this patient, if he recorded one.

Two analytes are deliberately unjudgeable without the slip: troponin and
D-dimer have per-lab cutoffs, so they are read against the slip's own printed
reference or its printed flag, and returned as "cannot judge, pending doctor
review" when the slip shows neither. Nothing here ever invents a cutoff.

An analyte the model returns without a numeric value is "cannot judge" as well,
and so is an analyte this table has never heard of. Both directions of that
error are safe: they put the value in front of the doctor instead of grading it.

Pure functions, no I/O, no cloud SDK: this module and its tests run anywhere.

# code, on the same normalisation the sentinel uses (sentinel.normalize:
# diacritics stripped, Arabic letter variants unified, Franco spellings folded),
# so "بَطني بتوجعني", "batni bt wga3ny" and "lower abdominal cramps" are one
# concept. It is deliberately a token rule and not a phrase list, and the
# sentinel's own table is untouched by it: this concept escalates a lab row, it
# does not wake the doctor on its own.
#
# Tense is not read here. The sentinel stands its concept rules down on a
# resolved marker ("embare7", "went away") because a finished chest pain is not
# an emergency; abdominal pain in the last 48 hours next to a positive test is
# the ectopic question whether or not it has eased, so the marker is ignored and
